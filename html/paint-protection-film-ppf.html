                <h2>What Is Paint Protection Film (PPF)?</h2>
                <p>Paint protection film (PPF), also called clear bra, is a clear film-like material made out of plastic polymers which when applied to your car's exterior with heat forms a strong, often times self-healing protective layer to prevent rocks, bug splatters, minor abrasions, and other physically and chemically damaging elements from degrading and chipping at your paint. This film is also used on airplanes, RV's, electronics, and screens.</p>
                <p>
                    For the most comprehensive and effective protection for your car, paint protection film (PPF) is one of the best options for long term care.  It goes by many names, such as Clear Bra, Clear Mask, Invisible Shield, Clear Wrap, Car Scratch Protective Film, Rock Chip Protection, etc.  The main reason for choosing paint protection film is to help keep your car looking like new for longer and preserving the paint in prestine condition.

                <h2>5 Benefits of Paint Protection Films</h2>
                <p><a href="/html/ceramic-coatings.html">Ceramic Coating</a> and paint protection film have very similar benefits for your vehicle's exterior paint. The main difference is that ceramic coatings are a glass shield that bonds with the paint to protect against UV rays, acid rain, smog, snow, etc from attaching to the surface of the paint.  Paint protection film does the same job except it is made of a softer material and the application is different.  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Self heal from scratches:</strong> Having a PPF will act as a barrier on your car from rocks kicked up from the road, debris in the wind, and chemicals from nature that will inevitably bombard it.  What is unique to PPF, is that when a small rock does hit it or you get some minor scratches, it can literally heal itself by applying some heat to the area and the polymers will fill in the scratches perfectly. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Prevents swirl marks when washing: </strong>The problem with using waxes and polishes on your car is the potential for creating tiny scratches from the swirling circular motion that is often sued when applying them.  This is happening because dirt and other tiny pieces of debris can get between the wax and your cloth.  But when you have PPF applied to the car, this doesn't happen and you won't need to ever worry about it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Lasts for up to 10 years:</strong> PPF can last longer than any exterior paint protection.  And when the time comes to replace it, it is very easy to remove and add a new PPF layer. It comes off smoothly and easily and a new PPF layer can be added immediately after removing the original.  And you can replace it as many times as you like!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Low Maintenance: </strong>One of the best features of paint protection film is the easy maintenance that comes with it. You don't have to do anything special to keep it clean or maintained other than your normal car wash at home or at a facility. The PPF has its own self-cleaning properties and is also dirt resistant on its own.  </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Customize your coverage: </strong>One of the clear differences between PPF and ceramic coatings is the fact that PPF can be applied to only specific spots if needed and can be tailored to the hardest hit points of your vehicle like the front bumper and hood. With PPF, you can decide what fits your budget and your needs.</p>

                <h2>Looking For Paint Protection Film in Los Angeles?</h2>
                <p>
                    When it comes to paint protection film, while it may seem like a miracle product that can protect against anything, it does not mean your car is bullet proof in terms of warding off chips, dings, and scratches.  Even if bird droppings are allowed to sit on it for a prolonged amount of time that can damage the PPF to the point of needing to be replaced.  What paint protection promises, is that it offers a strong layer of protection from everyday life and driving that would have otherwise chipped, scratched, and devalued your car.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like how a bullet proof vest can't protect against a shotgun or anything more substantial, a PPF won't guarantee damage protection from similar blows.  But if you are looking for a hardy solution to preventing wear and tear to your vehicles exterior paint that lasts for years and years, PPF is the best solution and one we recommend with high confidence and regard.
